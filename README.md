##Introduction

It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal movement using activity monitoring devices such as a Fitbit, Nike Fuelband, or Jawbone Up. These type of devices are part of the ‚Äúquantified self‚Äù movement ‚Äì a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing and interpreting the data.

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the course web site:

**Dataset**: Activity monitoring data [52K]
The variables included in this dataset are:

- **steps**: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as ùôΩùô∞)
- **date**: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
- **interval**: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken
The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset.



### 1) Code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data
Download the zip file and read into a dataframe

```{r}

if(!file.exists('activity.csv')){
    unzip('activity.zip')
}
activityData <- read.csv('activity.csv')

```

### 2) Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
Utilizes ggplot to chart a histogram of the frequency of days in which different ranges in steps were taken that day. NA values removed.

```{r warning = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

totalSteps <- tapply(activityData$steps, activityData$date, sum, na.rm=TRUE)
qplot(totalSteps, xlab='Total Steps on a Given Day (Bin Width = 1000)', ylab='Frequency of Days When X Number of Steps Taken', binwidth=1000, fill = I("steelblue"), col = I("grey"))
```


### 3) Mean and median number of steps taken each day
Display the mean and median values when NA values removed
```{r}
stepsMean <- mean(totalSteps)
stepsMean
stepsMedian <- median(totalSteps)
stepsMedian 
```

### 4) Time series plot of the average number of steps taken
A linear time series plot to show the average amounts of steps individuals took during certain intervals.

```{r}
averageSteps <- aggregate(x=list(meanSteps=activityData$steps), by=list(interval=activityData$interval), FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)
ggplot(data=averageSteps, aes(x=interval, y=meanSteps)) +
    geom_line() +
    xlab("Interval Value (Every 5 Min)") +
    ylab("Mean Steps Taken") 
```
	
### 5) The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps
The interval value which the highest steps were recorded on average
```{r}
maxStepsRowNum <- which.max(averageSteps$meanSteps)
intervalMaxSteps <- averageSteps[maxStepsRowNum,'interval']
intervalMaxSteps
```


### 6) Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing dataset
First determine how many null data values exist in the data set
```{r}
nullData <- is.na(activityData$steps)
table(nullData)
```

Assuming these null values are non-zero values and that individuals do take steps at these intervals, the safest value to input into these missing fields would be the average step count found at each interval. Code below makes a copy data frame and inputs null values with average step values captured at each interval.

```{r}
activityDataFilled <- activityData
for (i in 1:nrow(activityDataFilled))
{
        if (is.na(activityDataFilled[i,"steps"])==TRUE)
            {
                    activityDataFilled[i,"steps"] <- averageSteps[which(averageSteps$interval == activityDataFilled[i,"interval"]),'meanSteps']
            } 
}
```


### 7) Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed
New histogram with null values replaced with averages displayed below.

```{r}
totalSteps <- tapply(activityDataFilled$steps, activityDataFilled$date, sum, na.rm=TRUE)
qplot(totalSteps, xlab='Total Steps on a Given Day (Bin Width = 1000)', ylab='Frequency of Days When X Number of Steps Taken', binwidth=1000, fill = I("steelblue"), col = I("grey"))

stepsMean <- mean(totalSteps)
stepsMean
stepsMedian <- median(totalSteps)
stepsMedian


```
### 8) Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends
A new column to indicate whether a day was on a weekday or weekend needs to be added.

```{r}
weekends <- c("Saturday", "Sunday")
activityDataFilled$dateType = as.factor(ifelse(is.element(weekdays(as.Date(activityDataFilled$date)),weekends), "Weekend", "Weekday"))
```
Linear plot of step trends shows the distribution of when steps were taken Weekdays vs Weekends.
```{r}
averageStepsFilledDate <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + dateType, data=activityDataFilled, mean)
ggplot(averageStepsFilledDate, aes(interval, steps)) + 
    geom_line() + 
    facet_grid(dateType ~ .) +
    xlab("Interval Value (Every 5 Min)")  + 
    ylab("Mean Steps Taken") 

```
